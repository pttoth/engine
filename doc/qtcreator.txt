  configure multicore build (make) in IDE
--------------------------------------------------
By default, QtCreator runs 'make' in single threaded mode
To make it use multiple cores

- open your project in QtCreator
- on the left vertical bar, select Project
- scroll down to the 'Build Environment' section
- press 'Details' to open the dropdown view of the build env variables
- find or create the 'MAKEFLAGS' variable
- set or add the following parameter to it: '-j$(nproc)'

    the '-j' parameter for 'make' defines, how many jobs it should run parallel (default = 1)
    example usages:
        -j6
            use 6 threads
        -j$(nproc)
            use the 'nproc' command to find out the available core count
                (this number will contain the physical and virtual core count combined)
            use the number of cores available on the system
        -j
            use as many threads as can be theoretically run parallel (regardless of available core count)
            (WARNING: this can use up all of your RAM when compiling large projects!)

Now your build should be much faster, when built inside the IDE.
