libpttoth:
  may need to update 'Config' class
    to enable multiple different instances access different parts
    of the same config file

	finish v1.1.0 and base this project on it
	  remove 'math' from it

move math from libpttoth to a separate distinct "library"
	compile it as precompiled header

-------

Application
	restructure EngineEventCode
	basically the whole SDL_UserEvent part
	  of the Application and Engine

engine_events.h
	use an enum class instead
	  (depends on solution for the cases in the Application part)
	dump/rewrite the commented out operators

game.h
	rename 'Game' class to 'Engine'
	input handling should be passed here to a 'Controller' class
	  for which Engine will keep a pointer

	  subsequent inheritors will won't need to override Engine's
		input handling functions

	move 'SDL_Renderer' pointer to a 'Renderer' class
	  it will be able to init a renderer on a different thread later

	dump this 'PendingTask' behavior until
	  it's proven to be conceptually error-free

Component.h
	dump the bad OOP practice in 'RegisterComponent()'
		(ComponentBase, WorldComponentBase)
	review the entire tick behavior of Components and Entities

WorldComponent
	rework this
	  study quaternions already!

RealComponent
	check this again, but may not be needed in current project scope
	  mesh-based physics would use this somehow AFAIK
	
world
	COMPLETELY REWORK THIS
	is this even needed???
	
integrate OpenGLTutorials project

dump 'src/modified_libs'
