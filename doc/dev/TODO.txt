libpttoth:
  may need to update 'Config' class
    to enable multiple different instances access different parts
    of the same config file

	finish v1.1.0 and base this project on it
	  remove 'math' from it

move math from libpttoth to a separate distinct lib
  link it

-------

move everything from pttoth namespace to PT
remove dates from file headers
include libpttoth and dump 'pttoth::math'

game_events.h
	move BuildUserEvent to a common utility header
	move these events to a new "application_events" header
		or something like that

gamecontrol.h
	rename to EngineControl

game.h
	rename 'Game' class to 'Engine'
	inherit from a new 'EngineControl' class instead of 'GameControl'
	input handling should be passed here to a 'Controller' class
	  for which Engine will keep a pointer

	  subsequent inheritors will won't need to override Engine's
		input handling functions

	move 'SDL_Renderer' pointer to a 'Renderer' class
	  it will be able to init a renderer on a different thread later

	dump this 'PendingTask' behavior until
	  it's proven to be conceptually error-free

Component.h
	dump the bad OOP practice in 'RegisterComponent()'
		(ComponentBase, WorldComponentBase)
	review the entire tick behavior of Components and Entities

WorldComponent
	rework this
	  study quaternions already!

RealComponent
	check this again, but may not be needed in current project scope
	  mesh-based physics would use this somehow AFAIK

networking.h
	delet dis
	
world
	COMPLETELY REWORK THIS
	is this even needed???
	


integrate OpenGLTutorials project

dump 'src/modified_libs'

-------------
add dependency installer scripts
  windows and linux
add cmake support
dependencies
	libpttoth
	SDL2.0.8 or later
	OpenGL 3.3 or later
	glew
	assimp
	libpng
  later:
	TGA reader (libtga?)
	BMP reader (open source?, handwritten?)
	JPEG reader (libjpeg)
	vtf reader (Valve Texture Format)
	ZIP reader
