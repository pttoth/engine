make sure that the following dependencies are available in the PATH environment variable
    curl, 7-zip, cmake, make, mingw

    eg:
    C:\Program Files\7-Zip
    C:\tools\cmake\bin
    C:\tools\mingw\x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-sjlj-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin
    C:\tools\curl-7.81.0-win64-mingw\bin

note that 'make' is not available, use 'mingw32-make' instead (located among the mingw binaries)
    workaround to use it as 'make'
    - open cmd with (!)admin privileges(!)
    - navigate to the MinGW 'bin' folder (found in PATH)
    - type: mklink /h "make.exe" "mingw32-make.exe"

it's important to have 'cmake', 'make' and 'mingw' in a path, which contains no spaces
these usually install into the 'C:\tools' folder by default
    BUT this folder is NOT protected by Windows' TrustedInstaller security policy

    recommend installing them into 'C:\Program Files\tools'
    then creating a junction to that folder as 'C:\tools'
        - open cmd with (!)admin privileges(!)
        - type: cd C:\
        - type: mklink /d tools "C:\Program Files\tools"

currently only MinGW 8.1.0. is available as a prebuilt binary from a trusted location
    it has bugs with the 'std::filesystem' implementation
        (can't handle Unicode paths correctly)

    a newer compiler version is required to make use of those features correctly
        for now, it has to be built by hand, using the pre-built 8.1.0. compiler

        I may write a script for it, before a prebuilt 9.0.0 releases...
