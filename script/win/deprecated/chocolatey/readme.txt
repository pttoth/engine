I no longer recommend or advise using chocolatey for dependency installation.

It was nice and easy to handle, but a lot of repos have started failing on their antivirus tests.

I don't know, whether these are false positives,
  but I'm going to make a tutorial to set up the build environment by hand
  and I recommend using them instead of chocolatey.
